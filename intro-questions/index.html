			<li style="font-family:Verdana;"><b>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</b></li>

		<p style="font-family:Verdana;">There are more ways to engage the audience when designing for screen than designing for paper.<br>When designing for screen,there are more additional features like motion, various color options, and etc.</p>
		
			<li style="font-family:Verdana;"><b>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</b></li>

		<p style="font-family:Verdana;"><a href="https://work.co/grid">Work&Co</a><br><br><i>Work&Co</i>'s website is a great example of a website that shows an effective design because the hierarchy of information is created through<br>different sizes of types and color. Therefore, the information that is more important catches the user's attention easily.</p>

		<p style="font-family:Verdana;"><a href="https://www.swiss.com/worldofswiss/en/">World of Swiss</a><br><br><i>World of Swiss</i>'s website works well because all the information in this website is very clear and simple by using two colors:<br>red and white in which represents Swiss. Therefore, the user can easily find all the materials they need, and it makes the user<br>connected to the world of Swiss by providing all the information they need while living in Swiss.</p>

			<li style="font-family:Verdana;"><b>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</b></li>

		<p style="font-family:Verdana;"><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/">McKinsey&Company</a><br><br><i>McKinsey&Company</i>'s website works well because this website provides an interaction between the user and the company.

Also, the usage of color<br>in this website create balance and harmony between the text and background.</p>
