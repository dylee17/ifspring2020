		<p style="font-family:courier;"><a href="https://www.swiss.com/worldofswiss/en/">World of Swiss</a><br>World of Swiss's website works well because all the information in this website is very clear and simple by using two colors:<br>red and white in which represents Swiss. Therefore, the user can easily find all the materials they need, and it makes the user<br>connected to the world of Swiss by providing all the information they need while living in Swiss.</p>

		<p style="font-family:courier;"><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/">McKinsey&Company</a><br>McKinsey&Company's website works well because this website provides an interaction between the user and the company.
